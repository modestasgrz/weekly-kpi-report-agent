"""ADAPT: wire the kit's security tests (test_security.py) to this app. Owner-only, locked like tests/acceptance/.

Fill every function and constant marked ADAPT. A check that genuinely doesn't apply goes in NOT_APPLICABLE with
the reason; it then shows as skipped with that reason. Never use NOT_APPLICABLE to silence a failing check; a real hole the owner accepts
for now goes in KNOWN_OPEN (shows as xfail with the reason).
Check names: pii_logs, prompt_injection, model_output, step_skip, xff_spoof, cors, provider_error, body_cap, image_lock.
`make security` fails when a test listed in tests/security/EXPECTED_TESTS isn't collected by the full test run.
After adapting: uv run pytest tests/security --collect-only -q | grep '::' > tests/security/EXPECTED_TESTS
